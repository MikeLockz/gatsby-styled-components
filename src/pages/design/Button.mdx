# Button design guidelines

Button components let users know they can perform an action, like connecting their Ethereum account or starting a transaction.

# Design

Some best practices for using Button in your product.

### Don't just use icons

<Flex>
  <Box width={[1, 1 / 2]} my={3} mr={3}>
    <ExampleCard variant={"positive"}>
      <Button icon="Send" mb="3">
        Send Ether
      </Button>
    </ExampleCard>
  </Box>
  <Box width={[1, 1 / 2]} my={3}>
    <ExampleCard variant={"negative"}>
      <Button icon="Send" mb="3" />
    </ExampleCard>
  </Box>
</Flex>

### Don’t use buttons for navigational links

Buttons are for action-based tasks. Use Button.Text instead.

Do

Transaction history

Don't

Transaction history

### Keep button position consistent

This will let users know where to look when they want to perform actions

### Consider visual hierarchy of buttons

Don’t use too many buttons together on one piece of interface: prioritise the most important action. Use Button.Text and Button.Outline to give your actions visual hierarchy

# What's a transaction fee?

Every blockchain action requires a fee. This pays for someone in the network to update the blockchain. It doesn’t go to us. Be sure to save some ETH aside for fees.

# Content

Some best practices for writing Button microcopy.

### Keep copy concise

Don’t use articles (a, the, an) in button microcopy. This will make your button quicker to scan and shorter.

Do

Add wallet

Don't

Add a wallet

### Explain the next step, not the end goal

The user should understand exactly what will happen once they press the button.

For example, if you have a button that launches a QR code for you to scan with your mobile...

Do

Show QR code

Don't

Scan QR code

### Lead with a verb and follow with a noun

Don’t rely on the rest of the interface to inform the user about what their action relates to.

Do

Add wallet

Send Ether

Don't

Add

Send

Universally understood actions like "Save", "Next" and "Previous" etc may not need the noun.
